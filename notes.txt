NES IDEAS:
    -Will act as the global between
    -Will have a global counter acting as a clock cycle.
        things that rely on delays will need temp variables to count the cycles
    -how to handle memory mapping
    -might need class for memory


CPU IDEAS:
    -Input a ROM, and get the first line
    -Create system to read and print to console the current instruction
    -Create system print a message showing the details of each instruction  
        example: "add r1 r2 imm" showing what should be done.

PPU IDEAS:
    -Have 'n' layers of 256 * 240 SFML rectangles 
        n: refers to the number of sprite layers the NES can handle.
